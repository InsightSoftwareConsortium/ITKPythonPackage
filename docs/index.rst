Welcome to ITKPythonPackage's documentation!
============================================

This project provides a ``setup.py`` script to build ITK Python wheels.

ITK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.

The Python packages are built daily. To install the ITK Python package::

	$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	$ python -m pip install itk

For more information on ITK's Python wrapping, see `an introduction in the ITK
